# MIT-OCW-6.0001-PS1
# This project contains my work done for MIT Opencourseware's class 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python, Problem Set 1 Part C. I did not include my work for parts A and B as part C is largely just an extension of those parts. Included in addition to my code are the instructions for the problem set.
